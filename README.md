# dossier-next-sqlite-app

This is a template for an app using [Dossier](https://dossierhq.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).

## Getting started

- `npm init using dossierhq/dossier-next-sqlite-app my-project`
- `cd my-project`
- `git init && git add . && git commit -m 'ðŸš€ Created project ðŸš€'`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`

You should now have a working app running at http://localhost:3000. Try to add an entity type to the schema and create some entities.

A new SQLite database will be created in `data/database.sqlite`. By adding it to Git you can keep
the state of Dossier and synchronize it between computers.
